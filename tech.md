# Technical details

##  GitHub

Deutsche Boerse already has a license for GitHub Enterprise - our internal private instance of GitHub. All developer 
teams are already using it, utilizing GitHub workflow. Many operation units are also onboarding GitHub, being 
truthful to DevOps methodology. It is assumed, that also non IT departments will onboard GitHub, as sitting close to the 
product home have benefits directly impacting product development.  
**Note:** At the time being, there is no external access to this tool.

### Blockers

There is a conflict with Jira and Sharepoint, tools being adopted prior to GitHub.

## External access

Example given by Public Data Set product. It was announced via [Amazon website](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/deutsche-boerse-pds/), 
however interaction with customers is strictly handled by publicly accessible [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Deutsche-Boerse/dbg-pds). 
This can be seen as leading example from our **Product Development Lab**, how to tackle infinite loop of constant customer 
feedback with transparent process leading to specific impact on product quality.
